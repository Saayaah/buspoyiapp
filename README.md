### Project Description
Poya Bus is a first-of-its-kind emotional support application for the chronically late and tragically unlucky. It provides therapeutic relief to those who have just experienced the soul-crushing moment of watching their bus become a distant speck.

We offer a unique satisfaction package:

A fake bus ticket to the ride you never took
The rage-releasing joy of punching the bus 
A certified excuse note from the prestigious All Kerala Bus Association

Because sometimes, closure comes not from catching the busâ€¦ but from hitting it back.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Every day, thousands of commuters in Kerala experience the acute, existential pain of the Poya Bus (Missed Bus) phenomenon.

This micro-tragedy leads to a spiral of:

Regret ðŸ˜ž
Frustration ðŸ˜¤
Existential dread ðŸ˜©

The worst part? Thereâ€™s no tangible proof of your suffering. No one believes you. You are left alone with your tardiness.



### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We are here to fill that emotional void 
Poya Bus is the digital balm for your commuting wounds.
Start your healing with a Grief Assessment questionnaire â€“ blame your alarm, the chai, or the universe

Get a beautiful, fake bus ticket with your name and missed destination
Experience the satisfying virtual punching the bus that left you behind (no real buses were harmed)
Receive a professionally fake excuse slip, sealed and certified by the fictional yet prestigious All Kerala Bus Association

Because if you can't catch the bus, at least you can punch it.
